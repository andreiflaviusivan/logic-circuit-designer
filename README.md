# Logic Circuit Designer
## Design and Simulate Logic Circuits

Logic Circuit Designer is a lightweight software application whose purpose is to help you create logic circuits and visually simulate the operation.

It can be used for educational purposes, as it offer you the possibility to learn how to build a circuit design and understand how a logic circuit works.

## Intuitive Interace

You are welcomed by a well-organized set of functions that enable you to interact with your logic circuit. You are allowed to flip switches, change the input data, as well as watch how the output data is modified for sequential models. The multi-tabbed interface enables you to work with multiple circuits at the same time.

## Main features

Logic Circuit Designer gives you the possibility to add gates to a circuit and you can choose from basic (e.g. AND, OR, NOT XOR, NOR) or extended gates (e.g. button, led, clock).

Whatâ€™s more, you can select only gates, wires, or both of them, invert the selection, align the components, as well as set the simulation engine of the circuit on or off.

Other notable characteristics worth being mentioned are represented by the possibility to rename any input or output, undo or redo your actions, perform basic editing operations (cut, copy, paste), and print the generated circuit.

During our testing we have noticed that Logic Circuit Designer carries out a task quickly and without errors. It remains light on system resources, so the overall performance of the computer is not hampered.
